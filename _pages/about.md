I am a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering at the **Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)**. I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the **Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University**(THU SIGS), starting in 2026, advised by [Prof. Xiaozhi Wang](https://bakser.github.io/).

My research interests broadly lie in Trustworthy AI and Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, I focus on:
*   **LLM Safety & Alignment:** Building efficient and safe AI systems based on Large Language Models.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Exploring efficient RL methods for LLMs based on verifiable rewards(**RLVR**).

I have been fortunate to gain extensive research experience during my undergraduate studies. I was a research intern at the **State Key Laboratory of AI Safety, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)**, advised by [Prof. Shengyu Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ExampleID). During this internship, I proposed *Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD)*, a novel decoding-time defense mechanism, which was accepted to the **EMNLP 2025 Main Conference** as a **first-author** paper ([Paper PDF](/files/EMNLP2025_SSD.pdf)).

Before focusing on Safety-Aware Decoding, I researched defensive mechanisms in Federated Learning advised by Prof. Jinyan Liu, with one paper currently under review. I also worked on LLM Evaluation with Prof. Yang Song, where we developed evaluation metrics for RAG-based chatbots, leading to a co-first author paper accepted by ICBAIE 2024.

Beyond research, I am a competitive programmer with a strong interest in algorithms. I have won the **Silver Medal** in the **ACM-ICPC Regional Contest** and the Silver Medal in the CCPC National Invitational Contest.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/k-k1w-w1x-x) contains source code for my research projects and coursework. 
*   **[Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding](https://github.com/k-k1w-w1x-x/Speculative-Safety-Aware-Decoding):** Official implementation of my EMNLP 2025 paper.
*   **[Improved A3C with Bandit Models](https://github.com/k-k1w-w1x-x/RL-A3C):** A course project for *Reinforcement Learning* at BIT (received full marks), exploring strategy improvements for A3C.
*   *Note: Some interesting repositories are currently private as I am organizing documentation and cleaning up the codebases.*

### 📝 Blogs
I maintain a [personal blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/WXk-k) (in Chinese) where I document my learning journey in algorithms, competitive programming, and system design.
